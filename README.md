## Contributions

zuriportfolio is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let us know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/hngx-org/zuriportfolio-frontend.git`.
2. Open your terminal & set the origin branch: `git remote add origin https://github.com/hngx-org/zuriportfolio-frontend.git.web.git`
3. Pull origin `git pull origin dev`
4. Create a new branch for the task you were assigned to, eg : `git checkout -b feat-csv-parser`
5. After making changes, do `git add .`
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message : `git commit -m "your commit message"`.
7. To make sure there are no conflicts, run `git pull origin dev`.
8. Push changes to your new branch, run `git push -u origin feat-csv-parser`.
9. Create a pull request to the `dev` branch not `main`.
10. Ensure to describe your pull request.
11. > If you've added code that should be tested, add some test examples.
